          Hi everyone! My name is Aliya and I've been taking photos for as long as I can remember.
          From frequently organizing photoshoots with my friends to taking a class on it in high school, I have loved every aspect of photography. 
          It was only in the Fall of 2021 that I decided to try and become part of my church's media team. If you couldn't guess it, I became a member and it has been <i>such</i> a blessing to me in many ways.
          God has opened so many doors through my serving at church, and I thank Him that I have to have as much knowledge as I do now. While I am still learning and gaining experience,
          I wanted to create a platform to share with others the moments, people, and places I capture that I find to be beautiful. I hope you enjoy!
        </p>
